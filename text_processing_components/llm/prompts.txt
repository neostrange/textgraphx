        You will analyze the Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) output, which consists of a verb and its arguments (e.g., ARG0, ARG1, ARG2). While SRL provides a generic interpretation of event roles, it lacks domain specificity. Your task is to assign the most appropriate domain-specific labels to both the event and its participants.

        Carefully evaluate the SRL output to identify the event type or label.
        Assign the most specific and relevant domain label from the predefined lists.
        Do not assume all arguments require labeling—only label those that hold semantic importance in the given event.

        Rules for Accurate Labeling
        1. Event Labeling:

        Select the most precise event label from the provided list, considering context rather than just the verb.
        If an event involves a study, market analysis, or research report, it likely belongs to MARKET_TREND_REPORT, INDUSTRY_REPORT_RELEASE, or RESEARCH_PUBLICATION.
        Funding-related events must be categorized correctly:
        FUNDING_ROUND (Private investment in a company).
        GRANT_ALLOCATION (Government or institutional grants).
        VENTURE_CAPITAL_FUND_CREATION (Creation of a new investment fund).
        Regulatory events must be assigned the correct policy-related label:
        GOVERNMENT_REGULATION (Broad industry regulation).
        AI_POLICY_REGULATION (AI governance-specific laws).
        DATA_PRIVACY_LEGISLATION (Privacy-related policies).
        
        
        2. Participant Labeling:

        Only label semantically meaningful participants—do not assign labels unnecessarily.
        Assign the most specific label:
        If an entity refers to a university’s research, label it INNOVATION_PROJECT, not UNIVERSITY.
        If an entity is a data source (e.g., industry report, market trend), label it MARKET_INFORMATION.
        If an entity is involved in policy-making, label it GOVERNMENT, not just LOCATION.
        If a participant refers to funding sources, distinguish between:
        INVESTOR (Venture capital, angel investors).
        FUNDING (Grants, loans, financial support mechanisms).
        If a participant refers to physical or digital innovation centers, differentiate:
        INNOVATION_HUB (Networks, accelerators, incubators).
        INFRASTRUCTURE (Lab spaces, internet connectivity).
        
        
        3. Formatting Guidelines:

        Always output a well-structured JSON response with:
        A single event type.
        A list of participants, each with an appropriate entity label.
        Exclude irrelevant arguments rather than assigning incorrect labels.
        Use uppercase labels for "event_type" and "entity_label", but maintain JSON formatting conventions (lowercase keys).
        Do not output explanations, placeholders, or additional text—only structured JSON.
        
        Final Instruction
        Now, analyze the given SRL-based event output and provide only the domain-specific labels for:

        4. Event Type Classification Rules
        If the event involves a company partnering with another organization, classify it as PARTNERSHIP_ANNOUNCEMENT.
        If the event involves adoption of AI or new technologies, classify it as TECH_ADOPTION.
        If the event discusses job impact or hiring trends, classify it as EMPLOYMENT_IMPACT.
        If the event describes innovation efforts or future planning, classify it as INNOVATION_DISCUSSION.
        If the event presents market trends, statistics, or economic reports, classify it as MARKET_TREND_REPORT.
        Here’s an improved set of prompt rules to refine your model's event extraction:

        Ensure correct event type classification

        Define event-type mappings based on the trigger word and context.
        Avoid assigning MARKET_TREND_REPORT to general statements.
        Improve entity labeling accuracy

        Ensure entity labels match the meaning of the participant.
        Avoid assigning entity labels to modals, negations, and auxiliary words.
        Extract all relevant participants

        Identify who benefits or is affected by the event.
        Use coreference resolution to map pronouns to named entities.
        Prevent duplicate event extractions
        
        3. Formatting Guidelines:

        Always output a well-structured JSON response with:
        A single event type.
        A list of participants, each with an appropriate entity label.
        Exclude irrelevant arguments rather than assigning incorrect labels.
        Use uppercase labels for "event_type" and "entity_label", but maintain JSON formatting conventions (lowercase keys).
        Do not output explanations, placeholders, or additional text—only structured JSON.
        
        
        Final Instruction
        Now, analyze the given SRL-based event output and provide only the domain-specific labels for:

        The event type
        All relevant participants
        Do not output anything else.
        and strictly and religiously follow the Expected Output Json structure.

        2. Ontology & Rules
        Event Types
        Category	Definition & Key Triggers
        POLICY_ANNOUNCEMENT	Government-led policies/strategies ("launched," "announced," "approved"). Takes precedence over FUNDING_ALLOCATION if both apply.
        FUNDING_ALLOCATION	Explicit financial commitments ("funding," "grant," "invested").
        INNOVATION_ACTIVITY	R&D, prototyping, patents ("developed," "invented," "tested").
        COLLABORATION_INITIATIVE	Joint ventures across sectors ("partnered," "co-developed," "alliance").
        TECHNOLOGY_DEPLOYMENT	Real-world implementation of tech ("rolled out," "deployed," "piloted").
        INNOVATION_DISCUSSION	Debates, opinions, reports ("discussed," "argued," "analyzed").
        Entity Labels
        Category	Scope & Examples
        GOVERNMENT	Australian government bodies (e.g., "NSW Government," "Department of Industry").
        STARTUP	Early-stage ventures or founders (e.g., "AI startup," "entrepreneur").
        ACADEMIA	Universities/research bodies (e.g., "ANU," "CSIRO").
        INVESTOR	Active funders (e.g., "venture capital firm," "angel investor").
        TECHNOLOGY	Specific tools/platforms (e.g., "quantum computing," "blockchain").
        FUNDING	Monetary amounts or sources (e.g., "$10M grant," "budget initiative").
        MARKET	Industries, labor, or economic trends (e.g., "mining sector," "workforce").
        3. Classification Rules
        Events:

        Prioritize the primary action (event_trigger) over secondary context.
        For policy-linked funding (e.g., "budget allocates $X to startups"), use POLICY_ANNOUNCEMENT, not FUNDING_ALLOCATION.
        Use INNOVATION_DISCUSSION only for non-action discourse (e.g., "experts debated...").
        Entities:

        Infer roles from Australian context:
        "Innovation sector" → MARKET (not INDUSTRY_DEVELOPMENT).
        "Industry leaders" → BUSINESS (not ACADEMIA).
        Avoid over-labeling:
        "Digital platform" → TECHNOLOGY (not INFRASTRUCTURE).
        "Sydney-based incubator" → STARTUP (not LOCATION).
        4. Examples
        Example 1

        5. Quality Assurance
        Edge Cases: If unsure, resolve ambiguity using this hierarchy:
        GOVERNMENT > POLICY > FUNDING > TECHNOLOGY > STARTUP.
        Australian Context: Assume domestic focus unless stated otherwise (e.g., "EU regulations" → REGULATION but "Australian regulators" → GOVERNMENT).
        Flag Invalid Inputs: If labels are impossible to assign, return UNKNOWN with an explanation.

        3. Classification Rules
        3.1 Event Classification Rules
        - Use the primary action (event_trigger) to determine the event type.
        - Look for supporting evidence in the sentence to confirm the classification.
        - Look for supporting evidence in the sentence to confirm the classification. Example: If a government entity is mentioned alongside a new policy or funding announcement, prioritize the relevant trigger based on context.
        - If multiple event triggers are present (e.g., "policy update" and "funding allocation"), prioritize the most relevant event based on the context, such as the one that represents a direct action or innovation-related outcome. For instance, "policy update" may be classified as POLICY_ANNOUNCEMENT, while "investment" might be classified under FUNDING_ALLOCATION.
        - Avoid assumptions—only use available information.
        - If the event relates to funding, use FUNDING_ALLOCATION.
        - If the event involves a new technology being used, use TECHNOLOGY_DEPLOYMENT.
        - If the event is a discussion rather than an action, use INNOVATION_DISCUSSION.
        3.2 Entity Classification Rules
        - Classify based on meaning in context, not just the words.
        - Dual-labeling: If an entity belongs to multiple categories (e.g., a startup accelerator that also serves as an innovation hub), assign both relevant labels.
        - If a participant is a Government agency, label it as GOVERNMENT.
        - If a participant is a research institution or university, label it as ACADEMIA.
        - If it refers to a startup or entrepreneur, label it as STARTUP.
        - If an entity is a funding-related body, label it as INVESTOR or FUNDING based on context.
        - If a concept is about laws or policy, use POLICY or REGULATION.
        - If a phrase refers to a place, use LOCATION.
        - If an entity doesn’t perfectly match a category, assign the closest match. If you’re uncertain, use the broader category.

        - Favor general labels over overly specific ones.
        - If uncertain between two categories, pick the broader one.
        - When faced with ambiguity in event types (e.g., RESEARCH_PUBLICATION vs. INNOVATION_ACTIVITY), classify based on the action or result mentioned. If the event is tied to a publication or academic output, classify as RESEARCH_PUBLICATION. If it refers to a broader development or technological process, classify as INNOVATION_ACTIVITY.

        A sentence providing context (sentence_as_context).
        An event with a unique identifier (eventId) and its trigger word (event_trigger).
        A list of participants (participants), each with:
        participant_text (the entity phrase in the sentence).
        participant_id (a unique identifier for the entity).
        relation_type (semantic role label assigned by the SRL system).
        
        Your task is to assign labels to:

        - The event → Map the event to the most appropriate event type.
        - Each participant entity → Assign the most relevant entity label.
        
        2. Ontology
        Use the following predefined categories for event and entity classification. Do not generate new labels—only use these.

        Event Types (Action or Discussion Related to Innovation)
        POLICY_ANNOUNCEMENT → Government policy, strategy, or regulatory updates.
        FUNDING_ALLOCATION → Financial grants, investments, or funding commitments.
        INNOVATION_ACTIVITY → Development, research, or progress in technology/innovation.
        COLLABORATION_INITIATIVE → Joint efforts between Government, businesses, or academia.
        COLLABORATION_BREAKDOWN → indicates breakdown such as "withdrew," "cancels," "dispute," "failed partnership" etc. for example, "University cancels mining tech collaboration".
        INDUSTRY_DEVELOPMENT → Growth, transformation, or structuring of an industry sector.
        RESEARCH_PUBLICATION → Scientific or research output contributing to innovation.
        TECHNOLOGY_DEPLOYMENT → Implementation of new technology in practice.
        STARTUP_ACTIVITY → Entrepreneurial activities such as launching or scaling startups.
        ECONOMIC_IMPACT → Economic consequences of innovation-related activities.
        INNOVATION_DISCUSSION → Public discourse, expert opinions, or debates about innovation.
        ECOSYSTEM_SHIFT → "declined," "improved," "recommended", e.g., "Cluster development ranking drops to 39th".
        
        Entity Labels (Key Actors & Elements in Innovation Ecosystem)
        GOVERNMENT → Federal, state, or local Government agencies.
        BUSINESS → Established corporations or private-sector firms.
        ACADEMIA → Universities, research institutes, academic institutions, or academic bodies, e.g. Universities "ECU", "ANU", "UNSW", research bodies "UNSW", "CSIRO".
        STARTUP → Emerging or early-stage innovative businesses.
        INVESTOR → Venture capitalists, angel investors, or funding bodies.
        RESEARCH → Scientific studies, papers, or research efforts.
        TECHNOLOGY → Innovations, AI, software, platforms, tools, or technical systems.
        INNOVATION_HUB → Physical/digital innovation districts, e.g., "Sydney Startup Hub", "Perth Innovation Precinct".
        FUNDING → Grants, capital investments, or financial resources.
        POLICY → Laws, regulations, and Government strategies.
        INFRASTRUCTURE → Physical or digital systems that support innovation.
        PROGRAM → Government or private innovation-related initiatives.
        LOCATION → Geographic areas such as cities, states, or countries.
        REGULATION → Compliance, legal, and policy measures.
        MARKET → Economic demand, industries, and consumer trends.
        PUBLIC_SENTIMENT → Societal perception, media opinions, or general public response.
        
        3. Classification Rules
        Event Classification Rules
        Use the primary action (event_trigger) to determine the event type.
        Look for supporting evidence in the sentence to confirm the classification.
        Avoid assumptions—only use available information.
        If the event relates to funding, use FUNDING_ALLOCATION.
        If the event involves a new technology being used, use TECHNOLOGY_DEPLOYMENT.
        If the event is a discussion rather than an action, use INNOVATION_DISCUSSION.
        Entity Classification Rules
        Classify based on meaning in context, not just the words.
        Dual-labeling: If an entity belongs to multiple categories (e.g., a startup accelerator that also serves as an innovation hub), assign both relevant labels.
        If a participant is a Government agency, label it as GOVERNMENT.
        If a participant is a research institution or university, label it as ACADEMIA.
        If it refers to a startup or entrepreneur, label it as STARTUP.
        If an entity is a funding-related body, label it as INVESTOR or FUNDING based on context.
        If a concept is about laws or policy, use POLICY or REGULATION.
        If a phrase refers to a place, use LOCATION.
        If an entity doesn’t perfectly match a category, assign the closest match. If you’re uncertain, use the broader category.

            ]
            }


        5. Additional Guidelines
        If an entity does not fit a category, assign the closest match.
        Don't label these relation_type: R-ARG1, ARGM-MOD. 
        Use the event ontology consistently across all cases.
        Favor general labels over overly specific ones.
