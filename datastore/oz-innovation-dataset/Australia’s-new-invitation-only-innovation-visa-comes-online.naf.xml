Entrepreneurs, investors and researchers will need to be invited by Immigration minister Tony Burke to apply for Australia’s new National Innovation visa under changes introduced to “target high-calibre migrants”.

As the refreshed permanent migration scheme comes online, the government has updated the application rules to make the visa invite-only, limiting it as pathway for individuals previously eligible.

The government has also repealed the role of special envoy for global business and talent attraction, an artifact of the former government responsible for approving fewer than five visas applications.
