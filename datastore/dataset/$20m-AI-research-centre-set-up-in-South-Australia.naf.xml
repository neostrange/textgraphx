A new AI research centre has been set up in South Australia, bringing together experts from the CSIRO’s digital arm Data61 and the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML) to work on adoption challenges.

Jointly funded by the University of Adelaide, CSIRO and the South Australian government, the Responsible AI Research (RAIR) Centre aims to tackle issues of AI explainability, hallucinations and misinformation.

The $20 million centre will focus on building foundational models and better understanding the inner workings of AI systems when it becomes fully operational at Adelaide’s Lot Fourteen early next year.

Launching the centre on Monday, South Australia’s Industry, Innovation and Science minister Susan Close said the research would have a far-reaching impact and reinforces the state’s reputation as leader in AI research.

“Given its increasing prominence and importance in our society and economy, AI must use algorithms, guidelines, systems and case studies that promote human values and trust,” she said.

Of the $20 million investment into the centre, the University of Adelaide will contribute $10 million, with the remaining funding to flow from the CSIRO and the state government, according to a spokesperson for AIML.

A spokesperson for federal Industry and Science minister Ed Husic also said the national science agency would provide an additional $5 million in-kind contribution.

The South Australian government provided its $5 million for the centre through the state’s Research and Innovation Fund in June. It follows a $6 million grant for AIML to expand its research footprint in April.

AIML, the country’s largest university-based machine learning research group, also entered a five-year partnership with the Commonwealth Bank in September – which is said to have already paid for itself.

Interim RAIR director and AIML director Simon Lucey said the new RAIR Centre will position Australia as “a world leader in responsible AI research, opening up new avenues for investment and economic opportunity”.

“AI is already having a significant impact on the lives of Australians. There are, however, sectors that have not previously benefited from AI due to concerns about safety and reliability. Safeguards alone are not enough; we also need innovation,” he said.

Federal Industry and Science minister Ed Husic said the RAIR Centre would complement the work of the National AI Centre, which the government provided $21.6 million to in this year’s Budget.

“AI and automation could generate between $170 billion to $600 billion each year towards Australia’s GDP by 2030, so its crucial that local businesses can rely on the latest research to use AI safely,” he added.
